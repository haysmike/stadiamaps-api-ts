# Development Guide

## OpenAPI Code Generation

Much of the code in this project is generated by the OpenAPI generator.
Regenerating the generated portions of the codebase can be done simply with this command
(run this whenever new features / changes to the OpenAPI spec are released).

```shell
openapi-generator generate -i https://api.stadiamaps.com/openapi.yaml -g typescript-fetch --strict-spec true -o .
```

## Unit Tests

The project includes some unit tests as a sanity check, utilizing mocks and real API responses.
The test suites are specified using Jest and are fairly straightforward.

```shell
npm run test
```

## Dist build

```shell
npm run build
```
